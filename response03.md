De Certeau is gonna hack the planet
===================================

In discussing the difference between “work” and “leisure” de Certeau writes, “A distinction is required other than the one that distributes behaviors according to their place (of work or leisure) and qualifies them thus by the fact that they are located on one or another square of the social checkerboard—in the office, in the workshop, or at the movies (29). Activities are not tied to locations, but encompass the types of work or leisure we can do while crossing simplistic in-or-out separations. With all our internetworked technology, or even more powerful ubiquitous computing, we're not even necessarily sitting down to a computer anymore. We're logging in at the coffeehouse, grading outside under a tree, or responding to email in bed before going to sleep. Activities become distributed themselves across a range of physical/virtual locations tied to that activity's need. And pushing the work/leisure breakdown even further, tied to the context of the activity. For instance the programmer's live deadline versus the n00b trying to build his first site, or the 8 page paper due on your teacher's desk the next morning versus the budding artists creating her first comic book. Thinking of distributed activities across networks we have the creep of work into the home—often seen as an infringement of capitalism and a work-until-you-drop mentality into every facet of our lives—as more of a continual blurring of work and non-work in what we do. Work is not a tether to your desk, but a mulch-faceted amount of processes and techniques that we can harness across many locations. 

This ties to de Certeau's focus on the re-centering of culture/production on the individual, as opposed to the “expert” or “institution.” Instead of top-level directiveness we look for large-scale buy-in, or the space where everyday users get a say in production. Thinking to PW/TC, the more control (or at least access) the user has the more likely a peer-to-peer network of communication, support, and subversion can develop. For instance we see a lot of this emerging in DIY, or open-source tech where the barrier to entry is low enough for many to start getting their hands dirty. You don't need institution-approved training or an expensive manual, just some access and time and energy (and hope and dreams and etc.) Like Feenberg's hackers, we can make our own path through the city or develop our variation of a practice. A specific “place” can be owned or regulated by the institution, but a practice offers room for new ideas and activities to develop. De Certeau writes, “The long poem of walking manipulates spatial organizations, no matter how panoptic they may be: it is neither foreign to them (it can take place only within them) nor in conformity with them (it does not receive its identity from them)” (De Certeau 101). We have this mobility or agency in our response to the world around us. We construct our identity as such, and our rhetoric and movement stems from moving out of the comfort zone of a singular practice or way of doing things.
