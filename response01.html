<h2>
	Who Standardizes the Standards?
</h2>

<p>
	One of the most interesting threads I found in Johnson's work is the connection of mass production to technical writing. Granted tech comm. Rises from discussions of technical processes and products, but the growth of these huge industries to run things like metalworks, machine shops, and tool builders 
	necessitated a more complex level of interaction between different business owners and groups. The movement of materials and specific parts from one place to another, instead of generating all materials and production in-house, required more formalized and specific communication to avoid costly mistakes.

	To that end, the initial kinds of disparity in things like measurements was especially interesting to me. (42). The company required a very specific measurement of material, and so includes their in-house measurement to make sure it meets specifications. A practical, if inelegant, solution. The sections on early correspondence (66) follow that trend of situated, but direct communication. I loved the little nods to “the previous letter” as a way of keeping the slow back-and-forth on track (almost like an early bbs. Re: re: re: re:). Providing enough context in each communication to further the dialogue, situate the order or question, and avoid mistakes or confusion was key. I feel like maybe my business writing students could learn a thing or two by writing in such a situation where a confusingly worded communication could result in weeks of missed production.

    And it seems as these industries grew you would also have growing standardization to enable workers or professionals moving from one business to the next, or from early technical schools to industry. If your company is the only one to understand your conventions, you're going to have a very isolated business model and an uphill battle to bring new workers into the fold. The discussion of the discourse to create national standards (141-143) is especially interesting in this regard as you have various groups competing to lay down standards for steel quality. The American Section for Testing Materials (ASTM), which was formed mostly of manufacturers, began laying the groundwork for standards across the industry. However, they did so without the feedback of users (read: other industries that depended on their manufactured steel) or experts (consultants and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers) who also had a vested interest in the outcome. A survey of numerous manufacturers eventually yielded enough data to go on, but the internetworked nature of industry and the kind of ebb and flow that happens across completely different productions, services, state lines, and specializations highlights the need for technical communication that can navigate these waters. The formation of standards, and the whys and hows of the history of their implementation is entwined with tech comm. We've gone from sending the gauge we measure our products against to the manufacturer, to consulting various networked groups to lay out regulations and best practices for an entire industry. And as technical communicators, we're in at the ground level for not only recognizing standards, but also examining the procedures that are enabled (or stymied) by those standards.
