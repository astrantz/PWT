Johnson describes the interface as that tactile connection between designer and user, the negotiated space that enables every productive act by the user. The designer's mark is apparent, yet this connection is where the user gets to start “feeling out” the system, making mistakes, playing around, etc. and finding out what works for them. My phone's slide-out keyboard is never used, as the slightly smaller buttons than my numeric keypad were just small enough that I couldn't type anything without hitting 3 buttons at once. It's still faster to hit “1” three times for a period, or “3” twice for an E. The interface is the literal point of connection where the user takes over the device from the plans and designs of the manufacturer. 

Although Johnson refers more to interface as the physical aspect of technology, the visual, spatial, and organizational structure of interfaces are also of interest—specifically when looking at the design of systems like websites or digital repositories. To demonstrate I want to talk about GitHub specifically as a user-centered space where interface is negotiated out usefully. Like a wiki, GitHub offers a space for collaborative writing and designing without it being confined to one page. Anything you put on GitHub can be “forked” by users who get a copy of it for their own use. They can try something different, respond to questions you have, or even take the documents for a spin before synching the results back to yours. It's not the same as passing a document back-and-forth between writers, as users literally get the WHOLE of your stuff. Put up code? They can run with it. Put up a syllabus? They can change as much or as little as needed. There's definitely a design and a scope to what you choose to put onto your hub, but what happens afterward is totally in the user's hands. 

So how is this user-centered and why would it be useful for our class? The sharing of documents is nothing new, but the kind of all-access users-can-take-what-they-want and contribute, build, remix, change, complete, and complicate is what sets GitHub apart. It's user-centered because the designer/user dichotomy breaks down as code, text, images, whatever becomes part of the repository. Anyone can take and manipulate the work, and even the bare-bones method of forking a path from someone's work involves an act of productive knowledge creation. It's yours, now, so you can take it in the direction you want. The act of choosing what path to follow (and split from) is creating something new. And any change thereafter is a new path along the Hub.
