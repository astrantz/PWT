 I've previously read Feenberg's Critical Theory of Technology and I like how Alternative Modernity follows a similar thread of connecting numerous disparate theories and theorists into some semblance of a whole. I am in firm agreement with his positioning of technology as itself a network, social and constructed alongside the other institutions and hierarchies constructing the world. Ignorance of the underpinnings of society does not invalidate their construction of our world everyday. 
 
 What I wonder, then, is where innovation and the ostensible “newness” of new media come from. Feenberg positions hackers at the forefront of social and technological change by altering the system and moving in ways its creators did not expect, but I don't think we need such a grandiose term. Any act of interaction with technology in society establishes new ways of being and doing with technology. Users never work to exact specification, and that continual mediation and connection with technology, as well as the societal aspects of its operation and existence, is where these spots of innovation/disruption happen. It's hard not to see the technological determinism of our stuff when devices continually get faster, smaller, cheaper, and better with every iteration. But the cracks are visible when you discuss wider issues around our technology, such as the prices of materials or revolts at Apple factories. DIY and Open-Source software give a better case for themselves as tools of perhaps “less-grandiose” hacking by allowing more users an easier access to the conversation. These kinds of tools create a much better culture of disruption as they form an alternate path to the march of progress: room for sustainability, green research, alt. methods and mods, as well as possibilities for innovation that tackle the same problems in new ways. 
 
 Another spot that highlights the socially networked nature of our technologies is the move toward tactile interfaces, augmented reality, and ubiquitous computing. It seems counter-intuitive, but by hiding or distributing the technology itself out into the network we become more aware of the technological facets underpinning our society. The actual interface of the devices become more see-through, but the constant connection to the network and mediation of tasks and skills through these technological lenses pushes the societal/internetworked nature of our technology. More visible by becoming ubiquitous, or at least more intertwined by being a constant connection.
